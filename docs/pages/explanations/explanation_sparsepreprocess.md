# Representing operations using the Preprocess generalization


Preprocessing represents carrying out operations that involve `Format` objects. 
Reordering, partitioning, graph coarsening, matrix factorization, and tensor decomposition are a few examples of such operations.
Preprocessing in SparseBase is done in an object-oriented manner; users instantiate objects that they use to carry out preprocessing. 
Each object can contain multiple functions that handle different `Format` types, but all these functions will carry 
out the same preprocessing operation. 
Every object also comes with a matching and conversion mechanism. 
This mechanism allows a preprocessing object to take the user input `Format`, find a function that matches its format type, and use that function. If no such function is found, the mechanism converts the input into a different format for which it has a function.
This mechanism has two main benefits:

1. **Users need a single representation only.** Users do not need to worry about the format type of their data. The library will take care of doing the necessary conversions to carry out their work. Simply load your data and pass it to a `Preprocess` object and it will do the work for you.
2. **Developers donâ€™t need to cover the entire format space.** When a developer wishes to add a `Preprocess` type, e.g. a new reordering algorithm, they do not need to account for every input format type. A single implementation on a common format type will be sufficient; any object that is convertible to that format type will be able to use this reordering. Of course, if they wish, they could provide additional implementations for different formats.


Since preprocessing can encapsulate many operations, it is important to keep it as generic as possible. 
We achieve this generality by making each preprocess class abstract in terms of:

1. The number of `Format` objects it takes as input.
2. Its return type.
3. Its auxiliary hyperparameters.

This allows developers to implement virtually any type of operation on any number of `Format` objects. 
In addition, it lessens the burden on the users and allows them to explore the preprocessing space without having to worry about data representation.
