Welcome to SparseBase's documentation!
======================================

Our vision for
SparseBase is a library built in C++ that encapsulates, preprocesses,
and performs I/O operations on sparse data structures seamlessly and
optimally to provide a backbone for algorithms that use these structures.

It is designed with HPC (High Performance Computing) usage at the forefront. It is meant as a container of sparse objects such as tensors,
graphs, multi-graphs, and hypergraphs. It mainly focuses on re-ordering, partitioning, and
coarsening sparse objects. Also, it supports many different formats (representations) of sparse data and enables
smooth conversion between formats.

SparseBase is not meant as a library for carrying out downstream tasks with data it represents. It wonâ€™t do graph
embedding, tensor-tensor mathematical operations, or factorization, for example. Instead, it is a container and
preprocessor that will make carrying out different downstream tasks easier and more standardized.
It will give developers quick utilities in terms of converting between formats, preprocessing, and reading/writing.

The library is currently in an early stage of development. As a result the API is not stable and
likely to change in the near future.
