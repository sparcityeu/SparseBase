# SparseBase

SparseBase is a library built in C++ that encapsulates, preprocesses, and performs I/O operations on sparse data structures seamlessly and optimally to provide a backbone for algorithms that use these structures.

It is designed with HPC (High Performance Computing) usage at the forefront. It is meant as a container of sparse objects such as tensors, graphs, multi-graphs, and hypergraphs. It mainly focuses on re-ordering, partitioning, and coarsening sparse objects. Also, it supports many different formats (representations) of sparse data and enables smooth conversion between formats.

The library is still in early stages of development. As a result, the API is not stable and likely to change in the near future.
