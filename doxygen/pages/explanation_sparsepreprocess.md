# Representing functionality using SparsePreprocess

# Overview

Preprocessing describes *functionality kernels* involving `SparseFormat` objects. Reordering, partitioning, graph coarsening, matrix factorization, and tensor decomposition are a few examples of such kernels. Preprocessing in SparseBase is done using objects. Each object carries out a certain kernel and can contain multiple functions that handle different `SparseFormat` formats. Every object also comes with a matching and conversion mechanism for these functions. This mechanism allows the object to take the user input, find a function that matches the input format, and if none are found, convert the input into a different format for which it has a function. This mechanism has two main benefits:

1. **Users need a single representation only.** Users do not need to worry about the format of their data. The library will take care of doing the necessary conversions to carry out their work. Simply load your data and pass it to a `SparsePreprocess` object and it will do the work for you.
2. **Developers don’t need to cover the entire format space.** When a developer wishes to add a `SparsePreprocess` implementation, e.g. a new reordering implementation, they do not need to account for every input format. A single implementation on a common format will be sufficient; any object that is convertible to that format will be able to use the reordering. Of course, if they wish, they could provide additional implementations for different sparse formats.

The rest of this document will describe the hierarchy of `SparsePreprocess`.

# Hierarchy

Since `SparsePreprocess` can be used as an abstraction for many different kernels. It is important to keep it as generic as possible. We achieve this generality by making `SparsePreprocess` abstract in terms of the *preprocess kernel’s function signature*, or what we will refer to moving forward as `PreprocessFunction`. In other words, a preprocess type can be created for any combination of inputs and outputs — the data types of inputs and outputs have no restrictions, and there can be as many inputs as the developer needs. Obviously, inputs should have at least one `SparseFormat` object to justify using the `SparsePreprocess` matching mechanism.  

Using this generalization, we classify `SparsePreprocess` into different *types;* a `PreprocessType` is identified by the signature of its kernel, i.e., its `PreprocessFunction`. For example, reordering, partitioning, coarsening, and factorization are all different types, and this is the `ProcessFunction` defining the reorder type:

```cpp
ID_t* ReorderFunction(std::vector<SparseFormat<ID_t, NNZ_t>*>)
```

Concretely, each `PreprocessType` is defined by a class that is templated using the type’s `PreprocessFunction`. 

Each `PreprocessType` can have multiple *implementations.* These are different algorithms or approaches used to carry out this preprocessing, with each being represented by a class. For example, METIS, Kernighan-Lin, and Fiduccia-Mattheyses are all different implementations of the partitioning `PreprocessType`. Every implementation can have multiple functions, each accommodating different `SparseFormat` formats. This is where the function matching and format conversion takes place. For example, the METIS partitioning implementation can have a single function only that takes a CSR format as input. However, users will be able to use METIS partitioning even if their data was a different format — as long as that format is convertible to CSR.  

Finally, each `PreprocessType` can have one or more `PreprocessInstance` classes. These are adapters that take an implementation class and expose an API to the user. Every `PreprocessType` has a `PreprocessInstance` that can be used with all of its implementations. However, one can also build instances for specific implementations as well. For example, the `ReorderInstance` is an instance that can be used with any reordering implementation (RCM, degree, etc.) and it will expose the same API to the user. On the other hand, the `RCMReorderInstance` is an instance that is specifically made for RCM reordering, and its API can be specialized for it. The following example demonstrates the usage of preprocessing instances:

```cpp
COO<int, int, void> coo;
ReorderInstance<int, int, void, RCMReorder> rcm_orderer;
// Even though there is no function to carry out RCM Reordering 
// on a COO, the data will be converted to CSR behind the scenes
// and reordered.
auto order = rcm_reorderer.get_order(csr);
```

# Why use instance class?

An important design decision was whether or not to merge the preprocess type and preprocess instance classes into a single class. This would mean that a `PreprocessType` would be defined by the kernel’s function signature, as well as the public API of the type. Even though this approach might have resulted in cleaner code, we found it might not be as scalable as the current approach. The current approach allows for multiple APIs for a single preprocess type, which we believe might become necessary for more complex preprocessing types.
